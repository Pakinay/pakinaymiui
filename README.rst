About
=====
`AutoKey`_, a desktop automation utility for Linux and X11, formerly hosted at `OldAutoKey`_. Updated to run on Python 3. 

**Important**: This is an X11 application, and as such will not function 100% on distributions that default to using Wayland instead of Xorg.

.. _AutoKey: https://github.com/autokey/autokey
.. _OldAutoKey: https://code.google.com/archive/p/autokey/

Installation
============

**Please remove previous installations of both AutoKey and AutoKey-py3 fully before installing!**

Dependencies
++++++++++++

Python: 3.5

Python modules (common):
------------------------

- dbus-python
- pyinotify
- python-xlib

The dbus module *requires* manual installation, preferably using your distribution package manager.
Due to odd detection issues with pip3 and this particular package, it is not defined as a dependency.
Without having `dbus-python (PyPi link)`_ installed, AutoKey wonâ€™t start.

.. _dbus-python (PyPi link): https://pypi.org/project/dbus-python/

GTK frontend only:
------------------

- GObject Introspection
- PyGTK
- GtkSourceView
- libappindicator

QT frontend only:
-----------------

- PyQt5
    - SVG module, if not already bundled
    - QScintilla2 module, if not already bundled
- ``pyrcc5`` command line tool (Optional installation time dependency, only used when installing or updating from the git source tree using setup.py. If not present, a fallback that causes a slightly slower application start will be used.)


Install via pip3
++++++++++++++++

pip3 will automatically resolve and install dependencies, but dbus-python requires manual installation.

.. code:: sh

   pip3 install autokey
   # or, if you want the latest from this repository,
   pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/autokey/autokey

The "--user" option for pip may be added to install for the current user only.
To install system-wide, run pip3 as the root user.

Ubuntu/Mint/Debian
++++++++++++++++++
There is a repository available for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (and compatible derivatives, such as Kubuntu).
If your Debian based system is not supported by the PPA or the PPA is not up to date, you can build your own packages
(see below) or use the packages attached to the GitHub Releases page https://github.com/autokey/autokey/releases/.

.. code:: sh

   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sporkwitch/autokey
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install autokey-gtk
   # Or alternatively, to install the Qt5 based GUI:
   sudo apt install autokey-qt

Distro package not provided? Create your own package for Debian-based distribution using files under ``debian/`` . Check out the `Packaging`_ wiki page for details.

.. _Packaging: https://github.com/autokey/autokey/wiki/Packaging

Arch Linux
++++++++++

Up to date packages are available in the `AUR`_.

.. _AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/autokey/ 


Fedora
++++++

Avaiable from Fedora_ 27 onwards.

.. _Fedora: https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/autokey

.. code:: sh

   sudo dnf install autokey-gtk
   # or for kde
   sudo dnf install autokey-kde

Zero-installation Method
++++++++++++++++++++++++

AutoKey can also be used directly from the cloned repository. This is useful, e.g., for trying
out a new version without removing a current installation.

1. Start the Autokey daemon

.. code:: sh

   cd lib
   python3 -m autokey.gtkui
   # or for KDE
   python3 -m autokey.qtui

2. Start the Autokey UI (if desired) by appending the --configure or -c command line switch to the end of the command.

The commands accept CLI switches just like the regular installation, so
:code:`python3 -m autokey.qtui -lc` works as expected.
