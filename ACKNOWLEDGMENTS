Thanks go to Sam Peterson (peabody17), the original developer of 
AutoKey, for allowing me to join his project and not objecting 
when I more or less took it over.

My sincerest thanks to tiheum, the designer of the Faenza icon set for
Linux. One of his designs is the basis of AutoKey's icon and his superb
icon set makes my desktop a joy to use. 

I'd like to pass my gratitude to all who have made donations to the 
AutoKey project: theoa, jschall, mfseeker, jflevi, keycombat, rkcallahan,
bkudria, riffian, and many others.

Many thanks to the developers of xdotool, from which I copied the idea
of dynamically modifying the keyboard map to send non-mapped characters.

I also want to thank the developers of Phrase Express. Their 
application's UI was the inspiration for AutoKey's configuration window.

The below are the original acknowledgements from Sam Peterson.

Above all, I wish to thank my wife Margaret Tam.  You're always there
when I need you.  You're always there to support me throughout the
good and bad in life.  I love you my dear.

I'd like to thank Eddie Bell for his keylogger example.  It was the
turning point in my early development of the program that gave me what
I needed for monitoring keyboard input.

I'd especially like to thank Peter Liljenberg for writing the
python-xlib extension, without which this software wouldn't have been
possible.

I'd like to acknowledge Textpander, Texter and the Autohotkey
developers whose software was an inspiration to this software.

I'd like to thank all of the people on the Ubuntu forums who have
given me their feedback and/or tried the program (in no particular
order or preference): Vadi, Scarath, jackocleebrown, ugm6hr,
RebounD11, Bungo Pony, forrestcupp, kevdog, conehead77,
PartisanEntity, DjBones, antisocialist, Specter043, Linuxratty,
SanskritFritz, Martje_001, tribaal, Vitamin-Carrot.  I apologize
profusely if I have forgotten to mention anyone.

I'd like to thank SourceForge for hosting the project.

Lastly I'd like to thank Guido van Rossum for authoring the Python
programming language, and RMS for gcc and GNU Emacs.
