autokey (0.95.9-0) bionic; urgency=medium

  [Bug fixes]
  * Prevent data losses when deleting or moving directories from within AutoKey. AutoKey will only delete data it knows
    and keep unknown user data. So adding $HOME and then removing it again will not purge everything below it.
    Affected were deleting directories and moving them via drag & drop. Fixes issues #171, #332

autokey (0.95.8-0) bionic; urgency=medium

  [Bug fixes]
  * Qt GUI: Fix issue with Python 3.7.4 and PyQt 5.11-5.13.0 that prevented AutoKey from starting on certain
    distributions shipping this configuration, notably Kubuntu 19.10. Fixes issues #313, #301
  * Qt GUI: Fix crash when saving the currently edited item, after deselecting it in the tree view. Fixes issue #285
  * Qt GUI: Disable Main window -> Tools -> Insert Macro when not editing a Phrase. Fixes issue #276
  * Qt GUI: Add a warning that explains possible data loss when creating top level directories at used specified
    locations. See issue #171
  * GTK GUI: Fix application hang when setting a custom value for "Trigger on" in the Abbreviation settings dialogue.
    Fixes issue #315

autokey (0.95.7-0) bionic; urgency=medium

  [Bug fixes]
  * GTK GUI: Fixed system tray icon context menu entry `View script error`, which was non-functional, if the main
    window is closed. The entry now opens the main window first as a workaround,
    because a proper fix will require a major code overhaul. Fixes issue #222
  * Qt GUI: Fixed the truncated GPLv3 license text shown in the About AutoKey dialogue.
    The dialogue now shows the full license text. Fixes issue #258
  * Hardened the logic to read application window titles. AutoKey now works, if applications do not set the
    `_NET_WM_VISIBLE_NAME` property of their windows. Fixes issue #257
  * Fixed Phrase expansion using the Keyboard method, which was broken if AutoKey was started for the first time.
    Fixes issue #274

  [Other fixes]
  * Improved the debug logging output: Removed unnecessary output, clarified wordings, etc. See issue #230
  * Qt GUI: Display the current Python version number in the About dialogue.

autokey (0.95.6-0) bionic; urgency=medium

  [Bug fixes]
  * Fix the combination of phrase settings 'Match phrase case to typed abbreviation' and 'Trigger immediately' to cause
    Scripts and Phrases to trigger on each and every key press. Fixes issue #254 introduced in 0.95.5.

 -- Thomas Hess <thomas.hess@udo.edu>  Sat, 09 Feb 2019 18:34:00 +0200

autokey (0.95.5-0) bionic; urgency=medium

  [Bug fixes]
  * Fix window filter detection always returning Title: 'FocusProxy', Class: 'Focus-Proxy-Window.FocusProxy' on Java AWT
    applications. It now detects the proper window title and WM_CLASS attribute for Java AWT applications.
    Fixes issue #113
  * GTK GUI: Fix the window filter detection dialogue. On clicking OK, it hung the whole application. Now the dialogue
    window works as intended. Fixes issue #229
  * Fix abbreviation case folding (ignore case option) with abbreviations defined as UPPER CASE in the abbreviation
    dialogue. Options `Ignore case` and `Match case` now work with upper case abbreviations. Fixes issue #197
  * Prevent the keyboard from staying grabbed by AutoKey if exceptions are thrown while AutoKey performs a clipboard
    pasting action. Fixes issues #72, #225
  * Prevent writing `None` to the clipboard. This prevents autokey-gtk from deadlocking, caused by an unreleased mutex.
    Fixes issue #226
  * Restrict Phrase Undo functionality to phrases without special keys, because phrases containing special keys cannot
    be reliably undone. Fixes issue #196
  * Clarified autosave option wording in the settings window. The option now explicitly states what it does.
    Fixes issue #194
  * Force AutoKey to exit, if the X server connection closes, most probably at logout or session end. Fixes issue #198

  [Qt tray icon bug fixes]
  * Added »View script error« entry to the Tray icon context menu, like in the GTK GUI. Part of issue #158
  * Tray icon turns red, when scripts raise an error, like in the GTK GUI. Part of issue #158
  * If changing the tray icon theme in the settings (light or dark), instantly apply the new theme, without requiring
    an application restart. Part of issue #158
  * The tray icon now works, after if it is disabled in the settings and then enabled again. Fixes issue #223

autokey (0.95.4-0) bionic; urgency=low

  [Bug fixes]
  * Fix grabbed hotkeys being incorrectly received by other applications.
  * Fixed crashes when processing <code> literals in strings.
    It is now possible to place <code> and <code/> literals in Phrases.
    Additionally, such literals can be typed in scripts using the keyboard.send_keys function.
  * Increased the reliability of the window filter detection dialog in autokey-qt. The dialog allows sampling windows
    to aid writing window filters. Due to timing issues in certain cases, sometimes the window title of the previously
    active window was returned.

 -- Thomas Hess <thomas.hess@udo.edu>  Sun, 14 Oct 2018 17:15:00 +0200

autokey (0.95.3-0) bionic; urgency=medium

  [Features]
  * Phrase expansion can now always be undone using the backspace key, if the feature is enabled in the settings.
    Previously it was only be possible if the phrase was triggered by an abbreviation.
    Now it also works when using hotkeys or selecting phrases from menus.
    This also prevents crashes in certain cases.
  * Qt GUI: Add support for automatically starting `autokey-qt` during login. It can be configured in the settings
    dialogue. The configuration option allows to choose which GUI is automatically started, if both `autokey-qt` and
    `autokey-gtk` are installed simultaneously, and whether the main window should be shown automatically on launch.
  * Qt GUI: Added the notification icon theme selection to the settings dialogue. The added section in the general
    settings allow to choose between the light and dark theme, like in the `autokey-gtk` settings dialogue. Changing
    this setting currently requires an application restart to take effect. (Restriction lifted in 0.95.5)

  [Bug fixes]
  * Scripting API: The Python `__file__` global variable is now properly set for AutoKey scripts.
    It contains the full path to the Python script file currently running. Previously, it contained the full path to
    the `service.py` file of the currently running AutoKey instance.
  * Crash fix: Skip import of the AT-SPI interface, if importing of `pyatspi` fails with a SyntaxError. This may happen
    with certain versions of `pyatspi` on Python 3.7. For details see the GitHub issue #173.
  * Fix serializing the store during saving, if user stores recursive data structures. It now handles/skips lists that
    contain themselves or other circular referenced data structures.
  * GTK GUI: Fix autostart handling: Create the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autostart` (`~/.config/autostart`) directory, if it is
    not already present. Fixes #149
  * Qt GUI: Create the user data directories before initializing the logger system. This prevents crashes when
    autokey-qt is used for the first time or when the user wiped all previous data. Fixes #170
  * Qt GUI: Fix saving the "Always prompt before running this script" checkbox content when editing scripts. This option
    now works as intended again.

  [Packaging]
  * Stop shipping the `autokey.png` icon file inside a `scalable` icon theme directory. Moved to the appropriate raster
    image directory.
  * Corrected broken dependency package name in setup.py. The library is called `python-xlib` and not `python3-xlib` on
    PyPI.

 -- Thomas Hess <thomas.hess@udo.edu>  Tue, 21 Aug 2018 21:48:00 +0200

autokey (0.95.2-0) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Fix broken imports in autokey-shell script
  * Skip non-json-serializable data in script storage (both script local and global) during saving. This allows putting
    non-serializable items (like function objects) into the store without crashing autokey during saving.
  * [Qt] Fix minor bug when creating new items. Created items are now properly selected for renaming directly after creation.
